I asked a question on StackOverflow about why a code I was
analysing generated a false alarm - in 3 static analysers
I tested it with.

Frama-C people responded with the 'split status' suggestions
shown in the example code.

[My question, and the extensive answer from Frama-C people
is in here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62541252/static-analysis-erroneously-reports-out-of-bounds-access).
